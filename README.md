# EIQ-to-IDS  
Toolkit to take an EclecticIQ JSON outgoing feed, extract the useful observables and transform those into IDS rulesets.  

Please note that we consider this to be proof-of-concept code for generating Snort/SourceFire rules. You should really not blindly run this on production environments without careful checking of the generated rulesets.  
  
Check back regularly for updates, as development will continue.
